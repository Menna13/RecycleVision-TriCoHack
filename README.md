## Build and run

### Step 1. Clone the github repo source code


### Step 2. Build the Android Studio project

Select `Build -> Make Project` and check that the project builds successfully.
You will need Android SDK configured in the settings. You'll need at least SDK
version 23. The `build.gradle` file will prompt you to download any missing
libraries.


### Step 3. Install and run the app

Connect the Android device to the computer and be sure to approve any ADB
permission prompts that appear on your phone. Select `Run -> Run app.` Select
the deployment target in the connected devices to the device on which the app
will be installed. This will install the app on the device.


## Assets folder

_Do not delete the assets folder content_. If you explicitly deleted the files,
choose `Build -> Rebuild` to re-download the deleted model files into the assets
folder.
